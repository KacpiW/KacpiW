# Hi, I'm Kacper

Hello there! I'm a programmer deeply passionate about the world of data. AWS-certified and currently stationed at [GlobalLogic](https://www.globallogic.com/), I weave intricate data pipelines for a range of businesses, from small startups to established giants. The end of the workday doesn't mean the end of coding for me; I often find myself immersed in the exhilarating world of Rust and exploring latest tech trends. Through continual learning and relentless pursuit of the next challenge, I aspire to leverage technology to make a substantial impact.
